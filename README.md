# holySHI Language
holySHI is a simple, custom programming language designed for educational purposes. It features basic integer variable declarations, arithmetic operations, and print functionality.


## Features

- Variable declaration using `summonsoul` (supports only integer value right now).
- Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- Print statements using `chant`.

## File Extension

The holySHI language uses the `.hshi` file extension for its source files.

## Usage
### 1. Create a `.hshi` File
Write your holySHI code in a file with the `.hshi` extension. For example, create a file named `example.hshi`:
```plaintext
summonsoul a = 10;
summonsoul b = 20;
summonsoul sum = a + b;
chant(sum);
```
### 2 . Compile and Run Your Code
To compile and run your holySHI code, follow these steps:
#### 1.Compile 
```plaintext
g++ -o holySHI main.cpp
```
### 2.Run the holySHI programme:
```plaintext
./holySHI example.hshi
```
